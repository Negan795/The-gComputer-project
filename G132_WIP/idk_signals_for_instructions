how stack works:

stack pointer will hold address

ignore, use stack start and chrck in software
stack definer will be split, first 22 bits will hold starting address, remaining 10 bits will hold the size
SSSS SSSS SSSS SSSS SSSS SSss ssss ssss
if size = 0 then it only has 1k of memory
max is 1023, equivalent to 1048576k, or aprox 1M, these are words not bytes



active low signals:
    load IR
    increment address

ALU stuff:

    register or immediate:
    if condition
        alu OP code
        if both registers
            write to register
        if at least 1 is immediate
            enable falling edge
            if Y = imm
                falling delay
                
    
    register and address
    










interrupt handling:

    if any interrupt signal is set and load IR is 1 and instruction finished
        increment system stack pointer
        alt address system stack sel
        data out PC sel
        write out
        store interrup vector in PC
