This project has been going on for a year without yielding rewards and this I have decided to abandon it.

The main causes were poor planning, increasing complexity before finishing the basic features and low drive to finish it.

However I have managed to gain some experience from this project:
  - how to make a pipeline
  - what to add and not add to future designs
  - whan an orthogonal architecture is
  - how to better plan future projects
  - not to use different clock edges in different locations
